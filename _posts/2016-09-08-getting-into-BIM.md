### And Why It's Worth It To Do So.

A few years back I had an interesting conversation with a former colleague about how exactly one gets into BIM Management. Both of us had studied Architecture and both had studied the extra year to get the professional degree one typically does when aiming to become a **Registered Architect (RA)**. So, the question went, how did I go to being a BIM Manager when, as he said:

    "...everyone at work has an IT background and not an architectural one."

Have you ever done a Google Search on BIM Management but looked only at the images? It's weird - the majority of the images are either vauge diagrams, renderings or something "futuristic". Is it any wonder there's a big confusion about both what BIM Management is or what BIM Managers do?
